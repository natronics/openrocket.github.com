OpenRocket is an Open Source project licensed under the [GNU GPL](license). This means that the software is free to use for whatever purposes, and the source code is also available for studying and extending.

OpenRocket needs help to become even better. Implementing features, writing documentation and creating example designs are just a few ways of helping. If you are interested in helping make OpenRocket the best rocket simulator out there, _[please get involved](collaborate)_!
